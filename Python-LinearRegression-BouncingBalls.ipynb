    "# Project: Linear Regression - Bouncing Balls‚öΩ\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to optimize a ball pit for a local fast food joint's play area by investigating the bounciness of different sizes of balls. To achieve this, we conduct an experiment and record data points which we then analyze using the statistical technique of linear regression. This method allows us to understand and model the relationship between ball size and bounciness. Our challenge involves implementing linear regression from scratch in Python, which requires careful coding and consideration of various slopes (m values) and intercepts (b values) to find the line of best fit that minimizes the error for our dataset. Ultimately, our goal is to provide insights into how different sizes of balls will behave in the ball pit, thereby optimizing the play area for the best possible user experience."
